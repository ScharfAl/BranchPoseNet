# Whorl pose detector
Repo containing the code to run pose estimation to detect whorls in individual tree point clouds

This is a continuation of the work done by [Puliti et al.(2023)](https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/96/1/37/6628789) on whorl detection for coniferous trees. In this second version we replaced the bounding box detector model with a pose estimation model aimed at detecting the geometry of each whorl, with branches on the left side of the tree (blue dots), the whorl in the center in correspondence of the tree trunk (orange dots), and branches on the right side of the tree (green dots).
